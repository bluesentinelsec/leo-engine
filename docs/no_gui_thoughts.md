Notes from ChatGPT - keeping this around so I can cherry pick good ideas / remarks

Yes — there’s definitely value in shipping an engine that **doesn’t** bundle a GUI/editor, if you position it correctly.

You’re essentially saying:

> “Leo Engine is a runtime + tooling stack that gives you all the boring-but-essential parts of game development, without locking you into a specific editor or forcing a particular project structure.”

---

## Why this can be a strength

### 1. **Flexibility for developers**

* No “you must use our editor” requirement.
* Fits into workflows that already have a favorite level editor (Tiled, LDtk, Ogmo, custom tools).
* Doesn’t dictate your art pipeline — use Photoshop, Aseprite, Blender, whatever.

### 2. **Lower surface area to maintain**

* You’re not maintaining a large, complex GUI app.
* You can focus engineering time on **runtime stability, CLI tooling, and cross-platform builds**.
* Fewer moving parts = fewer bugs, faster updates.

### 3. **Lean onboarding**

* Small download size, minimal dependencies.
* New users can bootstrap and see results faster (CLI → code → sprite on screen).
* Especially attractive for devs who prefer terminal-driven workflows.

### 4. **Less “framework lock-in”**

* Developers structure their game however they want.
* Avoids the “Unity problem” where the project feels alien without the editor.
* Your engine is an *enabler*, not a *gatekeeper*.

### 5. **Appeals to programmer-first audience**

* Your stated target is “programmer-first workflow.”
* Many of those devs view editor UIs as secondary to having a clean API, predictable runtime, and solid build tooling.

## How it compares to “SDL + from scratch”

You’re right: even without a GUI, **Leo** can still be far less work than raw SDL because you’re shipping:

* **Asset pipeline** (packing, hot reload, compression, obfuscation)
* **Cross-platform abstractions** (graphics, audio, input, timing)
* **Integrated CLI** (bootstrap, run, debug, profile, package)
* **High-level helpers** (sprites, cameras, tilemaps)
* **Consistent build system** (works on Windows/macOS/Linux/Emscripten)
* **Optional high-level API** for rapid prototyping
* **Low-level API** for total control

A dev starting with SDL would have to either build or stitch together all those pieces themselves — and maintain them.

## Risks and how to mitigate

* **Perception**: some devs equate “engine” with “comes with a GUI/editor.”
  → Mitigate by making your CLI + docs **super discoverable** and showing how it integrates with popular tools like Tiled.
  * **Beginner onboarding**: non-programmers may struggle without a visual editor.
    → Mitigate by shipping example projects + templates so they can copy & tweak rather than start from scratch.

## Possible tagline for this philosophy

> “Leo Engine is the runtime and toolchain for developers who want control without busywork — bring your own editor, we’ll handle the rest.”

If you want, I can help you write a **positioning section for your README** that reframes “no GUI” as a deliberate, pro-developer choice, rather than a missing feature. This will make it clear to prospective users why it’s an advantage, not a limitation. Would you like me to draft that?
